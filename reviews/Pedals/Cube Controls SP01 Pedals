The way products look on our sim rig is pretty important to most of us. We may claim that it's not, but when there are very few prizes for us to win in sim racing, we tend to just buy our own. These Cube Controls pedals are the ultimate trophy to reward yourself for your hard work and dedication to sim racing. But are they all show and no go? Let's find out. I'm Laurence, welcome to the channel.

It's no secret that I'm a huge fan of Cube Controls and their products. Ever since I saw the CSX2 a few years ago, I just got this feeling when I heard their name being mentioned. I thought I'd never own any of their equipment and who knows, if it wasn't for this channel, I'm not sure I would ever have gotten to this stage.

So when I first saw these pedals in 2021, I was blown away. I thought they were the most beautiful pedals I'd ever seen. The blue finish with the strong but intricate structure, the smooth pedal faces and pops of bright iconic cube controls colour. I really was taken aback by them. By the time I finally got to try them for the first time, I had a lot more experience with high end brakes, which really helped me to stay grounded while reviewing these pedals.

All of the products in this review were sent to me free of charge for the purposes of this review and nobody other than me has had any say in the content of this video.

2. First Impressions
They look great on camera, but in person, they're even nicer. The quality of the powder coating, the shapes and subtleties are really nice. The release of these pedals took so long though that I actually overlooked one major thing. They never released a clutch pedal. So you'll have to forgive me, as I used my review hardware for all of my league races, and I can't do that without a clutch pedal. So I've had to use the Meca Evo clutch pedal and baseplate for this review.

Carbon face doesn’t match. Much nicer with matching faces.

Pedal faces invertible.

Adjustment in mounts

Brake connects to throttle

Plastic cover looks like engine cover

complex to change elastomers

where's the clutch?

expensive!?

no baseplate

Brake trails off on very hard press.

Good default setting. LOTS of adjustment for initial phase and last phase.

damper adjustment is really fine. it's not too intrusive but i kept it around the middle.

cube have achieved a very good average setting here

brake adjustment not illustrated in manual

hard cup appears to be slightly smaller than soft cup

the blue preload adjust tends to work itself loose over time
