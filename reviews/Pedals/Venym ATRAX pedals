curving on pedals is a bit odd
heel-toe is difficult
finish on pedals is a bit handmade
leds are pretty novel
clutch pedal face is tiny. clutch seems like an afterthought for a two pedal set. This is a pretty perfect 2 pedal set but not a great 3 pedal set if you like driving h-pattern.
can't adjust pedals back and forward without taking them off the rig
short throttle throw but great for me
People moaned about the FIA licensing when I posted first impressions.
Pedal angle very adjustable. Suits formula position even if pedal tray angle not adjustable
Sharp bolts.
Load cell on all pedals
Clutch bite point not adjustable
Available in lots of colours and finishes
Default configuration felt good to me, which is refreshing
