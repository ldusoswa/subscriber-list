After securely attaching the Spectra XR to your
wheelbase, plug in the 4-pin spiral USB cable into
the socket on the rear side of the wheel. Then plug
the other end of the cable into an available USB
port on your PC or USB Hub. Be careful to align the
locating pin of the connector to the 4-pin socket.
CAUTION: We recommend using a powered
USB hub to ensure a healthy and stable
connection between the wheel and your PC.
