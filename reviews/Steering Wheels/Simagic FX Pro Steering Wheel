Message to Simagic:
I got the latest sim pro manager. I’m trying out the FX PRO and the dash selector is pretty awful.

Firstly, it’s not intuitive that you need to click on the screen to change the dash.

Secondly, adding and removing dashes is painful. There’s no visual feedback when you click add or delete.

I finally figured it out a little and selected a few dashes. Then I exited out of the dash selector and the preview of the wheel is not in sync with the dash on screen but worse than that, none of my ‘Enabled’ dashes are even active.

It’s really not a nice experience for someone who has spent €900 on a steering wheel

You can change the Clutch Bite point on the fly by pressing and holding 1 of the clutch paddles, then rotating the right vertical thumb encoder up or down. This will increase or decrease the value by increments of 2.

Index and thumb grip nicely.

Gap behind and front works on ACC but not iRacing

Great stickers! Amazing quality. Easy to apply. However the coloured stickers don’t have great text options so I left them off. I’d like to see generic things like SCRN, PAGE, SCRL, MENU, arrows, etc as sticker options. Great that you get the tools for removing rotaries. Also get a tweezers

Individual LEDS are really nice. They don’t blend into one another
