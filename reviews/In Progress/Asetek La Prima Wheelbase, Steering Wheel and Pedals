Show pineapple grips aftermarket colour kits to hide the orange and change the look

Aftermarket wheel will always be a little further away
Can’t buy without rim

If you use the aftermarket qr for a formula rim, you’ll likely be replacing the la prima. Some aftermarket wheels require a universal hub as you cannot open the housing to boot into the QR from the inside of the housing. So keep that in mind when choosing the wheels that you want to use on this base

The main point I need to get across about this QR is that you might need to crack open your lovely billet wheel plate if you want the wheel face to be a similar distance to the Asetek ones and the fact that the standalone QR is different to the QR that’s not detachable from their own wheels.


Pedals
Green elastomer is harder, black is softer. Black is excellent for entry level . Plenty hard to get the benefit of load cell. Green is more hardcore.

Throttle squeaky

Environmentally friendly packaging


on the PCB-A, and then the 3rd party wheel manufacturers, like SOELPEC will use so they can make cables that fit natively.
