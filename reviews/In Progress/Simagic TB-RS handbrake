Has to mount to the left of the shifter

Not a good combo with the DS-8X

Bracket for mounting is different to pedals
Initially could not work with sim-hub

Overkill?

Front mounting point not the easiest to reach

Comfy handle. Wear over time?

Easy to change

easy to adjust the preload to give a physical deadzone before the elastomers. you can make it feel identical to your real handbrake.

sequential is not amazing. it's fine. the only real feel other than resistance is the end stop of the travel. it doesn't feel like you're engaging a gear. Fanatec has a slightly better feel.

h gate is slightly looser than the fanatec shifter. fanatec feels tighter, simagic feels more like a road car.

Keep hitting watch of rumble motor
