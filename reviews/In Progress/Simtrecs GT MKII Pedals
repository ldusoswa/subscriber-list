Usually when lesser known companies send products for review, there's lots to talk about and to work on. These are the Simtrecs GT MKII pedals and I can honestly say that I've never been swept off my feet quite like this before, especially not by a pedal set. I'm Laurence, welcome to the channel.

1. Introduction
On the left you’ll see all the sections in this video. I’ve put timestamped links to each section in the description below.

Simtrecs is a Hungarian company founded by Gabor Cserkuti. He comes from a radio controlled racing background and has always had a passion for Sim Racing. He developed the first version of these pedals in 2020 but felt that they could do even better.

2. First Impressions
As well as being a good looking pedal set, some details immediately caught my eye. The angle of the elastomer stack, for one. The tiny dampers build into the pedals and the Star Wars styling. I love the little blue accents and the use of black bolts. If you look closely, they're machined with intent and precision. In fact, they're incredibly light which suggest they'd be perfect for any sim setup including motion rigs.

The clutch hides its spring in the main pedal housing which is a very unique design.

If you look closely, you see a tiny rumble motor on the rear of the brake pedal, but not on the throttle. I'll cover that in more detail in a later section.

6. Throttle
Unlike many pedal sets with build in electronics, the throttle houses the brain of this pedal set instead of the brake. This is quite interesting and does mean that the cable from the clutch to the throttle is a little longer, but nothing to worry about.
