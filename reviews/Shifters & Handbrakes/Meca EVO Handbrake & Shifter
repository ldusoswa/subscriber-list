Handbrake default quite light. Can pull all the way to the end with relatively little effort. But this may suit some as it’s not unrealistic either

The height is important to a lot of people as they like a ‘full height’ device. It means that your hand only moves left and right from the steering wheel without needing to also go down.

Needs a large profile rig really. Something like a GT1 or bigger.

handbrake elastomers can get very heavy feel.

can't adjust amount of travel but that's similar on most elastomer stacks

my favourite is black and blue.

I'd love to see one of the black elastomers replaced with a slightly heavier shore, halfway between the black and the blue one. Or shorter elastomers

not made for simlab style profile
