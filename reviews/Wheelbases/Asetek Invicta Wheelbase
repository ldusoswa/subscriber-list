It’s surprising to me how many SC2 owners were considering switching to the Asetek range

Incredibly smooth

As time goes on, I’m disliking the styling less

Hey Laurence, a quick one regarding the still upcoming Invicta wheelbase review:

The software has had an update today, adding a few new features I've noticed so far:
- You can set a colour for the buttons when they are pushed, different from the normal colour
- You can have a "Latched button" mode. The colour will then change the different colour until you press it again. BUT, it also send a signal to the sim as if you are keeping the button pushed down. So for the ERS on the F1 cars we did on the hotlapping thingy, that would be really usefull

You can now turn off the rainbow idle mode
