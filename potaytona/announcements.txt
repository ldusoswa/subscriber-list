Potaytona Announcement #36 Sponsor / Prize

Is this real life? Simucube didn't just enter a team. They went a step further! They're giving away an active pedal set! YEP! An active brake, passive throttle and a baseplate. That's worth over €3,000 and this one is only winnable by those of you who donate €200 or more. The odds of winning this are phenomenal! I CAN NOT WAIT to give these away!

#Potaytona is a fundraiser by sim racers FOR real-world drivers. 100% of the funds raised are going directly to real-world racing drivers.
