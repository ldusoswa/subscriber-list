We have not yet begun to market this event to the general public. Therefore at this point in time, I would ask that you do not advertise or recruit others to create teams for the event. By design, we have not announced ANY prizes yet. This is to give companies time to organise themselves, but also gives us the opportunity to attract wholesome community motivated drivers, rather than drivers who only want to win prizes at all costs. This is working incredibly well, with the entry list already over half full.

I am still in talks with many high profile companies and content creators about this event. I cannot guarantee their participation, but it is a priority for me as it will attract more eyes and more donations.

Over the coming weeks, I will be creating promotional posts. Each company will get similar air time. We will also be having some fun with playing 'rival' companies against one another. For example, SOELPEC vs GSI or Asetek Simsports vs Simucube. This will be light hearted but will generate great interest from the audience.

So long story short, the slow rumbling of talks and organic growth of this event is because we are still building a high quality entry list for the on track action. Once that is nailed down, then we are going to push HARD with public posts, donation pleas, prize advertisements, etc.

I hope that this keeps you a little more informed on the roadmap for the event. We are just over 6 weeks away now. Thank you so much for your participation. If you have any questions or need clarifications or wish to make any adjustments to the previously discussed commitments, you know where to find me.

The excitement is already building on our discord: http://discord.gg/PotatoNation

We now have 39 teams registered. We have capacity for up to 60 but are capping the entries at 50. This is to cater for the situations where companies, content creators or esports teams make last minute special requests to be a part of the event. We feel that reserving these spaces for high profile drivers and teams is in all of our interest. It would be a shame to have to turn away people who will attract attention.

We are almost ready to publish the prize list to companies. This will be a provisional and confidential list, for your eyes only. This will show how we plan to use the prizes that you have so generously donated to date. Prizes will be awarded to podium finishers in both GT3 and GTP classes, with a large portion of prizes being used to incentivise donations. We are trying to position prizes as fairly as possible so that we do not present products as being favoured or promoted more than others. We will however have a certain natural hierarchy of prizes based on their price, as this is very easy for the drivers and donators to understand. This also gives companies the best opportunity to know how their prize is being leveraged well ahead of time. As I have said to you all individually, we want you to enjoy this event as much as the drivers and spectators. Our goals are to incentivise viewers to donate.

We have a professional sim racing esports photographer who will be taking action shots of every single car on track throughout the event. Images will be made available to companies and content creators as soon as they are available, including DURING the event. This is nice for your social media activities.

Media guidelines/suggestions will be published in due course. We are still not advertising the event yet, so please do not share it widely before that initiative begins. We want to finalise all company and content creator communications before we advertise to spectators/donators.

Social media packs will be made available to all drivers and streamers. This includes your company logos, event logos and on stream overlays. We are looking at simple ways for companies to be able to host the live stream on their social platforms, as we have gotten some enquiries about this.

Streamers such as Random Callsign, Gamermuscle and RadWeasel have confirmed that they are streaming the event. There are also many many smaller streamers. This will give a very nice boost in exposure, which I'm sure you are all very curious about.

Finally, and quite incredibly, we have now reached €29,000 in prizes, which is a collosal amount. I am eternally grateful to you but I do not underestimate the significance of your investment. My fundraising aims are set very high to match your generousity. I hope that we can achieve something special here, and I believe we will. So, in addition to having a professional broadcasting team and a team of dedicated live stewards, we have now recruited a dedicated prize co-ordinator to ensure that I have less to think about while conducting the event.

As always, if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

We are 3 weeks out from the event!

Entries - Entries are now FULL! We have opened a reserve list, just in case some teams decide to drop out. Contact me for the link if you (or any of your contacts) want to join the reserve list.

Prize allocation - Prize promotion is beginning as soon as we have some minor things finalised. We want to publish the intentions of prizes to companies before we announce them to the public. We will begin to announce prizes on Monday 19th. We will not be announcing all prizes at once. If you require any changes to your prize donations, please let us know as soon as possible. The main reason we are communicating the goals for your prizes is so that we can make sure that you are happy with how we are using your prize.

Donation rules

1. Donations make donators eligible for prizes. Every €5 represents a single chance of winning a spectator prize.
2. All donations before lights out on 9th of march count towards the Asetek La Prima bundle and the Simucube Pedal set
3. All other prizes are only for those who donate during the 10 hours race. Event sponsors are not eligible for spectator prizes. Event sponsors ARE eligible for driver prizes.
4. Drivers are eligible for prizes both on track and on stream.
5. Golden hour prizes are only for those who donate during that golden hour
6. Golden hour donators will automatically qualify for all subsequent non golden hour draws if they meet the criteria for said draws
7. Donations stack; if you donate €5 twenty times, you are eligible for the €100 draw.

There are some companies who are yet to decide their prizes and they are not represented on the list. As you can appreciate, organising this takes a lot of effort but not all companies have had the time to finalise their prizes.

We have already raised over €3,000 for our real life drivers. All money raised will go directly to the sponsored drivers. None of the additional costs of stewarding, broadcast, photography, etc are being paid for by the funds raised. 100% of the funds will go to drivers.

We now have some more additional streamers and also many more real life racers. It's going to be amazing. I'll keep this B2B update short so that you can concentrate on the incredible prize list. If you have any issues, please let me know as soon as possible. Obviously we would like as few changes as possible at this stage. PLEASE DO NOT SHARE THESE IMAGES. For now, they are a secret. We would like to announce them through our official channels.

All feedback welcome,

Laurence

WOOOO! We are 1.5 weeks away from the event and things are looking GOOD! We are currently making 2x announcements per day. Find attached schedule for the announcements. Announcements are at 12pm and 5pm UK/Irish time. The reception to these announcements has been INCREDIBLE. Please find the announcement schedule attached.

Our discord is FLOODING with content creators and drivers. Please feel free to join. Any of you who are being interviewed on stream will need to be in Discord. Please ensure that you have access as soon as possible. If you are interested in an on stream interview and have not already confirmed (list attached), please message me. I will be finalising interview times next week.

The fundraiser is already over €5,000! We also have some new sponsors and prizes. Please also find a complete list of sponsors attached.

If there are any issues or concerns about anything in this update, please let me know as we can update it as soon as possible. As you all know, I have a full time job and a family so I don't have a huge amount of time to triple check everything. I am counting on you to keep me in check here. I would rather problems appear before the day so that we can have an excellent event as planned. I do have several unpaid admin 'staff' for this event. We are a team of 6 people.

Next week we will 100% finalise the stream schedule. I hope to communicate this with you also.

As always, you know where to find me. Thank you so much for making sim racing history with me:

- First iRacing Endurance event with weather
- First Sim Racing community to raise money for real world drivers
- First time that companies battle it out on track in an official capacity
- First time a 10 hour sim racing stream gives away over €35,000 in prizes
- The first major sim racing esports event which wasn't aimed at esports drivers

Pretty cool!

It's RACE WEEK!

Prize announcement video goes live at 7pm GMT today. Please join us for the premier: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEN9qw1sAsc It contains all the prize rules, special guests, etc. We have raised almost €6,000 for real world drivers already.

Sponsors: I need one last thing from you! Please give me a 2 sentence 'elevator pitch' with the message you want me to represent for your company on stream. It can be your goals, a new product that you're promoting, anything. Just keep it to two sentences and I will ensure that every viewer hears your words rather than mine when I proudly present your company on stream.

Streamers/Content Creators: If any content creators are streaming the event, please consider using the on screen widgets (simple OBS browser sources) that I have developed. One shows the donation total/target and the other shows a notification every time there's a donation. Media/Streamer pack: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1no6GMJQYGxFZI9_1x1atwsc1iPfBHUe0p7BcVqnel5c/edit?usp=sharing

I'm super excited. This will be my last communication before the race. I hope you are all as excited as I am. I'm so proud of what we have achieved together. I hope that you are too.

Laurence
